# Express-MVC-Template

```
>MVC stands for Model, View, Controller is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.
Each one of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
MVC is architecture used in building Web Servers that focus on reliability and making the development process much simpler and easier since it composes the Web Server into three separate parts.
